## GE Capital’s Financing Proposal
GE Capital has offered RadNet a $360 million financing package, divided into $225 million First Lien Debt (FLD) and $135 million Second Lien Debt (SLD). This proposal sets the stage for detailed negotiations and finalization of the financing terms.

## Funding the Acquisition
To meet the $82.6 million owed to Radiologix shareholders, RadNet plans to issue 22.6 million shares at $1.75 each, raising approximately $39.6 million. This results in a funding shortfall of $27.6 million, accounting for a deficit and additional fees, necessitating further debt financing.

## Goodwill Adjustment in Asset Valuation
The acquisition will increase RadNet's goodwill by $50.6 million, reflecting the premium over the book value of Radiologix’s equity.

## Changes in Liabilities and Equity
The acquisition leads to a $32 million decrease in shareholders' equity due to the write-off of Radiologix’s equity, partly offset by a $15.2 million increase from new stock issuance net of fees.
